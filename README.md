# Testing Javascript with Jest
Course of testing javascript with Jest taken at Platzi
> After I finished the course I made a test for a function that converts a common int or float to a number with venezuelan format (useful for prices). You can run this specific test with the following command after install the project: 
```bash
$ npm run test -- amount
```
## Install
```bash
$ npm install
```

## Main npm commands
To run all the test:
```bash
$ npm run test
``` 

To run only a specific test:
```bash
$ npm run test -- nameTest
``` 

To run with watcher to get instant reports:
```bash
$ npm run test:watch -- nameTest
``` 
 
To get a complete report of tests (including a nice HTML report):
```bash
$ npm run test:coverage
```
